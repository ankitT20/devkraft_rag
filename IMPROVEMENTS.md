# Live Voice RAG - Improvements and Enhancements

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Audio Interruption Handling ✅

**Problem**: During conversations, when asking a question requiring database search, the model would continue the previous response, causing overlapping audio (3-4 seconds overlap).

**Solution**: Implemented client-side Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with automatic audio interruption:

```javascript
// Client-side VAD threshold for detecting user speech
const VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.01;

// When user starts speaking, stop ongoing audio playback
if (isSpeaking && !userSpeakingDetected) {
    userSpeakingDetected = true;
    stopAudioPlayback(); // Interrupts current audio
    console.log('[INPUT] 🎤 User speaking detected - interrupting playback');
}
```

**How it works**:
1. Monitors audio input RMS (Root Mean Square) levels
2. Detects when user starts speaking (RMS > threshold)
3. Immediately stops all active audio sources
4. Clears audio queue to prevent scheduled chunks from playing
5. Logs interruption events for debugging

**Benefits**:
- No more overlapping audio
- Natural conversation flow
- Prevents 3-4 second overlap issue
- Works in conjunction with server-side VAD

### 2. Enhanced Search Query Display ✅

**Problem**: When model searches the knowledge base, users couldn't see what was being searched.

**Solution**: Display the actual search query in the conversation transcript:

**Before**:
```
🔍 Searching knowledge base...
✓ Found 3 relevant sources
```

**After**:
```
🔍 Searching knowledge base for: "Theorem 5.2 from the research paper..."
✓ Found 3 relevant sources
```

**Code**:
```javascript
// Display the search query in transcript
const query = args.query || 'knowledge base';
addTranscriptMessage('system', `🔍 Searching knowledge base for: "${query}"`);
console.log('[FUNCTION] Search query:', query);
```

### 3. Model Thinking Indicators ✅

**Problem**: No visibility into when the model is processing/thinking vs actively generating response.

**Solution**: Added thinking indicators in console logs:

```javascript
// Check if model is starting to think/generate
if (content.modelTurn && !content.modelTurn.parts) {
    console.log('[THINKING] 💭 Model is thinking...');
}

// When model completes generation
if (content.modelTurn && content.modelTurn.parts) {
    console.log('[THINKING] ✓ Model generated response');
}
```

**Log output**:
```
[THINKING] 💭 Model is thinking...
[FUNCTION] Search query: Theorem 5.2 from the research paper...
[THINKING] ✓ Model generated response
```

This helps track:
- When model receives user input
- Processing time for RAG searches
- Response generation timing
- Overall latency breakdown

### 4. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Configuration

**Overview**: The system uses dual-layer VAD for optimal conversation flow:

#### Server-Side VAD (Gemini)
- **Automatic**: Enabled by default
- **Handles**: Model interruption detection
- **Purpose**: Model stops generating when user speaks
- **Configuration**: Managed by Gemini Live API

#### Client-Side VAD (Frontend)
- **Threshold-Based**: `VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.01`
- **Handles**: Local audio playback interruption
- **Purpose**: Stops speaker output when user speaks
- **Configurable**: Adjust threshold in voice.js

**Configuration Options**:

```javascript
// Adjust sensitivity (in voice.js)
const VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.01;  // Default
// Higher value (0.02) = less sensitive (user needs to speak louder)
// Lower value (0.005) = more sensitive (detects quieter speech)
```

**How to Test VAD**:
1. Start a conversation
2. Let model speak
3. Interrupt by speaking
4. Check console for: `[INPUT] 🎤 User speaking detected - interrupting playback`
5. Verify audio stops immediately

### 5. Improved Audio Source Management ✅

**Problem**: No way to stop all active audio sources when interruption occurs.

**Solution**: Track all active audio sources and stop them on interruption:

```javascript
// Track active sources
window.activeSources = [];
window.activeSources.push(source);

// Stop all on interruption
function stopAudioPlayback() {
    window.activeSources.forEach(source => {
        try {
            source.stop();
        } catch (e) {
            // Source may have already stopped
        }
    });
    window.activeSources = [];
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean interruption handling
- No orphaned audio sources
- Memory efficient
- Instant response to user input

## Testing the Improvements

### Test Overlapping Fix
1. Start conversation
2. Ask about weather
3. While model is speaking, interrupt: "What is RAG?"
4. **Expected**: Audio stops immediately when you start speaking
5. **Log**: `[INPUT] 🎤 User speaking detected - interrupting playback`

### Test Search Query Display
1. Ask: "Explain Theorem 5.2 from the research paper"
2. **Expected**: See in transcript: `🔍 Searching knowledge base for: "Theorem 5.2..."`
3. **Log**: `[FUNCTION] Search query: Theorem 5.2...`

### Test Thinking Indicators
1. Ask any question
2. Check console logs
3. **Expected**: 
   ```
   [THINKING] 💭 Model is thinking...
   [THINKING] ✓ Model generated response
   ```

### Test VAD Sensitivity
1. Speak at different volumes
2. Monitor: `[INPUT] ✓ Sent X audio chunks, RMS level: 0.XXXX`
3. Adjust `VAD_THRESHOLD` if needed
4. RMS > threshold = speaking detected

## Performance Impact

| Feature | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Client-side VAD | Minimal | Simple RMS calculation per audio chunk |
| Audio source tracking | Negligible | Array operations only |
| Query display | None | String formatting only |
| Thinking indicators | None | Console logging only |

**Overall**: All improvements have minimal performance impact while significantly enhancing user experience.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Visual VAD Indicator**: Add UI indicator when user is speaking
2. **Adjustable VAD UI**: Allow users to adjust threshold in settings
3. **Turn Indicators**: Show when it's user's turn vs model's turn
4. **Thinking Animation**: Visual indicator in UI (not just logs)
5. **Search History**: Show recent searches in sidebar
6. **Manual Interruption**: Button to manually stop model response

### Advanced VAD Options
- Implement noise cancellation
- Add voice fingerprinting for multi-user scenarios
- Adaptive threshold based on environment
- Integration with Web Audio API's voice isolation

## Configuration Reference

```javascript
// voice.js configuration
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
const MODEL = 'gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025';
const DEBUG_AUDIO = true;
const SEND_SAMPLE_RATE = 16000;    // Input audio sample rate
const RECEIVE_SAMPLE_RATE = 24000;  // Output audio sample rate
const VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.01;         // Voice activity detection threshold
```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Still Overlaps
- Check VAD threshold: `console.log` shows RMS levels
- Increase threshold if too sensitive
- Decrease threshold if not detecting speech

### Search Query Not Showing
- Check: `[FUNCTION] Search query:` in console
- Verify function call args contain `query` field
- Check backend logs for RAG search requests

### Thinking Indicators Missing
- Enable console logging
- Filter for `[THINKING]` prefix
- Check if model turn messages are being received
